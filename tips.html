  <h2>Pratical travel tips</h2>
  <h3 style="text-align:center;color:grey;">Carry enough cash</h3>
  <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="cash.jpeg" width="50%"  style="margin:0 auto;"></div>
<p>
&nbsp&nbspIn China,credit cards like Visa and Mastercad may not always work,many shops/resturants may not accept them,
because China has its own credit cards.So it is wise for you to carry enough cash.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;color:grey;">Prepare a VPN before going</h3>
  <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="vpn.jpg" width="50%"  style="margin:0 auto;"></div>
<p>
&nbsp&nbspMany websites such as Facebook, Google, and Instagram are blocked here in China.
Some applications on your smart devices and access to emails may require a VPN
connection to work so it is highly recommended to get one.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;color:grey;">Think what to pack for China early</h3>
  <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="luggage.jpg" width="50%"  style="margin:0 auto;"></div>
<p>
&nbsp&nbspEssentials include passport (and visa), enough money (or a card to withdraw it), enough of the right clothes (check out the weather),
and any medication you need (you may need a translated doctor's note to get it through customs).
Smartphones are a handy spacesaver, especially if equipped with a VPN.
You may also need an adapter for any electronics you bring as China uses 2 or 3 thin-pin sockets at 220V.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;color:grey;">Watch out for public and school holidays</h3>
  <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="crowded.jpg" width="50%"  style="margin:0 auto;"></div>
<p>
&nbsp&nbspHolidays are great. They put everyone in a joyous mood. Watch out though! Chinese locals usually travel during these periods.
Travel costs (hotels, flightsâ€¦) usually skyrocket during this period,and those famous tourist sites will be extremely crowded.Generally, try to avoid festivals,
unless you want to experience them!
</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;color:grey;">High-speed rail is better than flying for some journeys</h3>
  <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="crh.jpg" width="50%"  style="margin:0 auto;"></div>
<p>
&nbsp&nbspLong bus rides are no more comfortable in China than elsewhere, but China's swish new high-speed trains give you excellent intercity options.
They may even be faster than travelling via plane as stations may be closer to the city centers than airports.
