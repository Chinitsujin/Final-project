  <h2>Learn about Guangzhou</h2>
<p>
&nbsp&nbsp Guangzhou,capital of Guangdong sheng (province), southern China. Its city centre lies near the head of the Pearl River (Zhu Jiang) Delta, more than 90 miles (145 km) inland from the South China Sea.
Because of its position at the meeting point of inland rivers and the sea, it has long been one of China’s main commercial and trading centres. It has served as a doorway for foreign influence since the 3rd century CE and was the first Chinese port to be regularly visited by European traders, who called it Canton.
The city is a historic centre of learning. And as a centre of political activity for the Chinese Nationalist leader Sun Yat-sen (Sun Zhongshan), it was one of the cradles of the Chinese Revolution of 1911–12.Guangzhou is celebrated for its many handicraft products, including ivory carvings, jade objects, embroideries, fans, porcelain, and paper umbrellas. These, along with the city’s famous cuisine and its many museums and other cultural attractions, have made Guangzhou one of China’s principal tourist destinations. Considerable effort has been focused on improving tourist facilities, and tourism has become an important component of the local economy.
